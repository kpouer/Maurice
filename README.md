# Marcel

## Description

This is an emulator of Thomson MO5.
This repository is a fork of the MO5 java emulator repository https://github.com/kpouer/marcel which was intially a fork
of the original repository which is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/marcel/

Of course the licence remains BSD Licence and all the credit goes to the original author.
My goal was to learn Rust and I thought that porting this emulator would be a good way to do so.


## Loading tapes

It is possible to load tapes by pressing F2 and selecting a .k7 file.
